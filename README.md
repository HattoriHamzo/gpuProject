<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77831591/170317681-f9c913e1-0318-4536-a2d6-f652a7ab201e.png)

This project is a machine learning oriented project, What I want to say with this .. This project has many different outputs, you can use it for Gpu Pricing (Like mine), stocks, stock pricing ... And many more things, even things related to medicine.

Why I did this?:
* Your time shouldn't be focused on spend hours trying to find better pricing on many webPages. So this project solves that, you only have to enter this webApp and you can look at the actual pricing of the gpu's
* You can use the machine learning model for other purpouses, like stock pricing for example 
* You only need to feed data on the model and It'll do his job

You can't use this program locally, because It's deployed on Azure (Virtual Machine Instance) and Aamazon Web Services (Elastic Compute 2) and the database is also from Amazon Web Services (Relational Database Service)

### Prerequisites

You need an Azure account with the susbscription you want / you need
You also need an Amazon Web Services with the subscription you want / need 

Once you are ready to deploy it 

* Bash
  ```sh
    python -m luigi --module taskName --local-scheduler
  ```
You also can see the workFlow on the browser (In these cases is not necessary)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PabloLopezSO/gpuProject
   ```
2. Install the requirements.txt
   ```python
